# MapColoring
In the map coloring problem, adjacent cities of a country should be colored with different colors. 

This repo provides a solution to map coloring problems using constraint satisfaction problem methods. It colors the Australia map using the backtracking algorithm.

Firstly, I defined the constraints and variables (cities) and then, employed the backtracking algorithm to find the possible solutions (ways) to color the map.
